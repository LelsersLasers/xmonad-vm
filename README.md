# xmonad-vm
My personal XMonad (and xmobar and picom) config(s). FOR VM

NOTES:

run picom with 'picom --round-borders 1' not just 'picom'

the picom is this fork (https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom)

to install this picom on arch: $ git clone https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom-ibhagwan-git $ makepkg -si

Need to do: have gaps in tiled mode even with 1 window , fix floating layout , make new windows become top of stack not below or above current window , change color of window count , make xmobar transparent , make all colors the same (like same transparence with bar and windows, chrome scheme matches bar, dmenu theme) , make the sound buttons work

Need to decide:

picom: round corners or shawdows? shawdows on dmenu? dmenu or rofi?
